===============================

Implementation of an OAuth2 authorization server using Katana project (OWIN specification).

Alexus Authorization server is the infrastructure for implementing application and API authorization.
OAuth 2.0 focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web
applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.http://oauth.net/2/
Instead of using the credentials such as user name and password to access a protected resource,the client obtains an access token
To request an access token, the client obtains authorization from the resource owner.The authorization is expressed in the form of an
authorization grant, which the client uses to request the access
token.  OAuth defines four grant types: authorization code, implicit,
resource owner password credentials, and client credentials.
